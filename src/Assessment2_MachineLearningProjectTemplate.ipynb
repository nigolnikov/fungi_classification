The requirements for each are set out below.\n","Note that the assignments are very similar to the Data Science module, but that you are given more freedom in selecting the dataset and the use of techniques.\n","\n","<font color=red>**Dataset**</font>\n","\n","The choice of the datasets is free, **but please do not use the datasets discussed in the lectures. <font color=red>Do not use the irsi and MNIST dataset. </font> Here is a list of datasets, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml, for your reference**. Your experience in the Data Science module should allow you to pick problems that are challenging, yet manageable.  \n","\n","<font color=red>**Techniques**</font>\n","\n","The techniques should be the ones that are discussed in the Machine Learning unit.\n","Examples are: \n","\n","* Bayesian Linear Regression. For example in highlighting the differences between classical linear regression and Bayesian approaches on small dataset. Where does model uncertainty matter? What does Bayesian model selection entail and how is it used in practice.\n","\n","* Bayesian Logistic Regression. Apply the Laplace approximation and then research extensions such as variational approaches.\n","\n","* Use of neural networks in classification and regression tasks. Plenty of scope for interesting projects here. \n","\n","* Use of Gaussian Mixture Models, for example in the use of outlier classification. Also mixtures of other distributions such as Bernoulli can be considered.\n","\n","* Use of Graphical models for classification tasks. The project should involve learning parameters and/or the structure of the model from data.\n","\n","* Sampling Approaches.\n","\n","* Kernel-based approaches such as SVM. For example, compare the performance of SVMs and neural networks.\n"," \n"," \n","### Option 1: Individual project: two techniques on a dataset \n"," \n","More ambitious projects that build on these techniques are welcome. Projects that do not achieve their intended outcomes can be successful if plausible hypotheses for why the chosen approach did not work are provided. This provision should encourage you to seek out more interesting problems. \n","The use of external software such as sklearn, pandas, R, tensorflow, PyTorch, etc. is encouraged, but should be acknowledged and the way they are used should be described accurately in the report. \n","A suggestion and a warning: there are very interesting examples of data analysis projects around on the Internet. In some cases, trying to replicate this may lead to an interesting project. If you decided to go this way, you carefully have to describe the original project, where it was found and how your project sets itself apart from what you already could find on Internet. There is a clear risk of falling foul of plagiarism here. If in doubt, consult the module leader.\n","\n","\n","### Option 2: Group project: four techniques on a dataset\n","\n","You can collaborate in groups of two to solve the given task if you wish; the workload must be shared equally. If you choose to be in a group then you must apply four techniques on the dataset, with each student taking on the responsibility of applying two techniques and analysing their results. The pre-processing stage must be shared\n","across the techniques.\n","Each student will submit their own individual report indicating at the top if you have collaborated with another student on this project. You will be assessed based on your individual contribution to the work, therefore you must make your contribution\n","clear in your submission.\n","The techniques we look for are as in the individual project.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hS6ErMouLGxr"},"source":["## 1.
